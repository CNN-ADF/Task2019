There are a number of different activation functions, each of which are more or less useful under different circumstances. The four activation functions that you are most likely to encounter are, arguably, [ReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/ReLU), [Tanh](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/tanh), [Sigmoid](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/activations/sigmoid), and [Softmax](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Softmax). \n",

        "ReLU, has in recent years, become the default choice for use in MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). ReLU has two advantages over Tanh and Sigmoid: it is computationally much more efficient, and, it allows us to use deeper networks because it does not suffer from [vanishing gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem). As a result of their success, a number of ReLU variants, such as [LeakyRelu](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LeakyReLU) and [PReLU](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/PReLU), have been developed.\n",

        "Both Tanh and Sigmoid are found in LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks, which we will find out more about in the coming days. They are also useful in MLPs and CNNs where we want the output to be bounded between -1 and 1 (Tanh) or 0 and 1 (Sigmoid).\n",

This tells us how good our model's predictions are compared to the actual labels (the targets), with a lower loss meaning better predictions. The standard loss function to use with a **multi-class classifier** is the **cross-entropy loss** also known as the \"negative log likelihood\" for a classifier. Suppose we have a classification problem with $C$ classes. A classifier is trained to predict a probability distribution $p(y | X_i)$ for each input $X_i$ from a batch of $N$ examples. The vector $p(y|X_i)$ is $C$ dimensional, sums to one, and we use $p(y|X_i)_c$ to denote the $c$th component of  $p(y|X_i)$. The true class for example $i$ in the batch is $y_i$ and we define the indicator function $\\mathbb{1}[y_i=c]$ to be 1 whenever $y_i = c$ and $0$ otherwise. This classifier has a cross-entropy loss of\n",

So the above expression is minimised (note the negative at the front) when the model places all its probability mass on the true labels for all the examples. Remember that  log(1)=0 , thus the closer all probabilities of $y_i = c$ are to one, the lower the loss will be and the better the model will be performing.\n",

This is an example of how a model's in-sample performance differs from its out-of-sample performance. It may even be considered **overfitting** (where the model failing to generalise its in-sample performance to unseen out-of-sample data). There are a number of ways we can address this, but first, it's important to realise that we should try and keep the number of evaluations on the test set to a minimum. \n",

After each epoch of training (or every K epochs where K can be a fraction), we evaluate our model on this validation set (without updating the model parameters). This gives us a good sense of how well we expect our model to do on out-of-sample data. In this way, the validation set acts as a surrogate for the test set which we can safely use during model development and training. We can also use this validation set to tune our model by selecting hyperparameters such as the batch size, sizes of layers or the network architecture. \n"

Underfitting occurs when the model does not have enough complexity (also known as capacity) to learn a general pattern.
