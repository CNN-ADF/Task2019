The purpose of machine learning is to *automatically* adjust the values of $w_1$ and $w_2$ to find a suitable decision boundary! But to do this, we need to mathematically specify some **loss** or **objective** function. The loss is a function of the parameters $w_1$ and $w_2$ and tells us how good a certain configuration of the parameter values are at classifying the data. This function is defined such that it reaches its optimum setting when it is minimised, i.e. the *smaller* its value, the *better* the separation between the classes. An additional property a loss function can have that is often crucial for machine learning is being *differentiable*. A differentiable loss function allows us to use *gradient-based optimisation* to find its minimum and the corresponding optimal values of $w_1$ and $w_2$. \n",

Scalars are 0-dimensional tensors, vectors are 1-dimensional, standard matrices are 2-dimensional, and higher-dimensional tensors have 3 or more dimensions. You can think of dimensions as representing groups of numbers that mean the same thing. For example, for images, we often use 3-dimensional tensors where the first dimension represents the red, green, and blue color channels of the image, and the next two are the columns and rows of pixels of the image. \n",

You will have encountered this mode if you used Tensorflow before or attended the Indaba last year! The second mode, called [\"Eager-mode\"](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager), is a lot newer and evaluates Tensor operations imperatively (in the order you write them), similar to NumPy and PyTorch. Eager-mode is slightly less performant but a lot more intuitive, especially if you've never used a \"define-and-run\" programming style (like graph mode) before, and is therefore the mode we will use in these practicals.
